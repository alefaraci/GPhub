[`GPhub`](https://gp-hub.dev/) offers an interactive guide to Gaussian Process (GP) libraries. This project is built using [`Hugo Framework`](https://gohugo.io/), `GO Template`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS`. The guide features a comprehensive dynamic table to provide an easy-to-use and intuitive reference for exploring the GP libraries available to the data science community. Whether new to GP or experienced in the field, the table simplifies the process of selecting the ideal GP tool that best suits one's needs.

The table is available by opening the `Table.html` file on a web browser of your choice.

## Editing

### üë®‚Äçüíª Adding a new library to the Table

To add a new library to the table, you need to create a new `PackageName.yaml` entry in the `gphub/data/libraries` directory by running:

```shell
cd gphub
make -f new_library name=PackageName
```

This will gerate a new file using this base YAML template:

```YAML
